Delivery_time -> Predict delivery time using sorting time Build a simple linear regression model by performing EDA and do necessary transformations and select the best model using Python

# Linear Regression
There are two types of Regressions.

1.Simple Linear Regression

2.Multi-linear Regression

## Simple Linear Regression:
```sh
When input variable and output variable is having linear relationship we can use this Regression model. 
This correlation between input and output variable can be positive or negative. 
Both input variable and output variable should be continuous.
  
```

## Data Used :
```sh
Delivery_time: depending upon sorting time we have predicted delivary time using linear model
```  
## Programming:
```sh
Python
```
